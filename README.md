# File Transfer Program (Python 🐍)

A simple file-transfer program (basic FTP-like) implemented in Python using the standard `socket` module.

## 🔧 Overview

This project implements a minimal file transfer utility using Python sockets. It’s designed for learning and experimentation — ideal if you’re exploring network programming, sockets, or want a simple tool to send files from one machine to another over a network.

Specifically, it includes:

- A server component that listens for incoming connections and receives file data.  
- A client component that connects to the server and sends a file.  
- Pure-Python implementation (no external dependencies beyond standard library).  
- Basic transfer of arbitrary files (text, binary, etc.).
